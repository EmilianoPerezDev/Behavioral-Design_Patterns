# Behavioral Design Patterns 

This repository contains examples of implementations of various behavioral design patterns in [Project Name]. Behavioral design patterns are a set of patterns used to effectively and flexibly manage behaviors between objects and classes.

## Included Behavioral Design Patterns

In this project, we have implemented the following behavioral design patterns:

1. **Observer Pattern**: This pattern allows defining a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes its state, all dependent objects are notified and updated automatically.

2. **Strategy Pattern**: The strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one of them, and makes them interchangeable. It allows the algorithm to vary independently of clients that use it.

3. **Chain of Responsibility Pattern**: This pattern passes the request along a chain of handlers. Each handler decides whether to process the request or pass it to the next handler in the chain.

4. **Command Pattern**: The command pattern encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing parameterizing clients with operations, queuing requests, and supporting undoable operations.

5. **Interpreter Pattern**: This pattern is used to define a grammar for interpreting a language and provides an interpreter to interpret sentences in the language.

6. **Iterator Pattern**: The iterator pattern provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.

7. **Mediator Pattern**: The mediator pattern defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. It promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly.

8. **Memento Pattern**: The memento pattern captures and externalizes an object's internal state so that the object can be restored to this state later.

9. **State Pattern**: The state pattern allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.

10. **Strategy Pattern**: The strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one of them, and makes them interchangeable. It allows the algorithm to vary independently of clients that use it.

11. **Template Method Pattern**: The template method pattern defines the skeleton of an algorithm in the superclass but lets subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.

12. **Visitor Pattern**: The visitor pattern represents an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure. It lets you define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates.

## How to Use

In the "Patterns" folder, you will find code examples for each of the patterns mentioned above. You can explore these examples and learn how these patterns are implemented.

In the "Exercises" folder, you will find another examples for each of the patterns mentioned above.
